  <p> You look a each choice, and it is pretty easy for you to choose the rope, as you see a hook on the ceiling that you could hang it onto easily. It takes a few tries (which is a little embarrising) but you can hook the rope on it to be secure. </p>
  <p> You've only ever seen thi in the movies, so you give it a shot, and try to hang on and slowly climb your way down. </p>
  <p> as you try to make it down, you can't hold a grip enough to support your weight. This wouldn't be a problem if it didn't burn your hands... which starts to be extremely painful after a few seconds. </p>
  <p> As your hands start to burn more and more, it starts to become impossible to hang on, and you just have to let go of the rope. Luckily, you didn't notice how far down you are, and you barely fall 10 feet, which at that point you just land on your feet. </p>
  <p> You hit the ground with a thud, and as you look up, you see that the cave leads deeper, and your hands are still burning. As you turn around, you see this giant... pool. But you're underground? Well, it doesn't matter. What does matter, however, is that you have to choose. </p>
